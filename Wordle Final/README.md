# Wordle Game in Java  
The game allows the user to guess a 5-letter word, providing feedback on each guess using color-coded hints. It aims to recreate the core gameplay of the popular Wordle game.
*Note: This game must be run on a platform that supports colored printing to display the feedback correctly (such as a terminal that supports ANSI escape codes).*
